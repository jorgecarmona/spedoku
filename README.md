# Spedoku... Another Sudoku React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to install
Install dependencies
### `yarn install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Note
This app has `<React.StrictMode>` set in index.js. This causes Sudoku puzzle to load twice on load. This is expected in dev mode but will work fine in production mode.
